# Svelto.ECS.Vanilla.Example
Svelto.ECS example for Net Core / Net Standard

The whole Svelto framework has been designed to be platform agnostic. This is the simplest proof of concept to make Svelto.ECS work with Net Core and Net Standard projects.

If you don't know Svelto, check my other repository, especially Svelto.ECS and Svelto.Tasks

**Note: The folders Svelto.ECS, Svelto.Tasks and Svelto.Common, where present, are submodules pointing to the relavite repositories. If you find them empty, you need to update them through the submodule command. Check some instructions here: https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto.ECS.Vanilla.Example/wiki**
